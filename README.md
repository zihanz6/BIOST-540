### Project Overview
A CD4 cell count below 200 is one of the diagnostic criteria for AIDS. The AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) study 193A was a randomized, double-blind study of 1309 AIDS patients with advanced immune suppression. Patients were randomized to one of the four daily regimens, i.e. zidovudine alternating monthly with group 1: 400 mg didanosine,  group 2: zidovudine plus 2.25mg of zalcitabine, group 3: zidovudine plus 400mg of didanosine, and group 4: zidovudine plus 400mg of didanosine plus 400mg of nevirapine. The CD4 counts were scheduled to be measured at baseline and every 8 weeks in the 40-week follow-up period. This project aims to investigate the relative clinical efficacy of the four treatment regimens for HIV-infected patients with advanced disease via longitudinal measurements of subjectsâ€™ CD4 cell counts throughout a 40-week study period.
